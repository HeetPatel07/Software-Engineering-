## Branching Strategy 
We have used git flow strategy throughout the project. We have a dev branch derived from the main branch. Each of the member made another branch from dev and they individually worked on their branch. After completion of the task assigned the member would merge this branch with dev. Later the dev branch would merge with main before the release.
